# RealCrypto.Activities
The observation of the lack of advanced cryptographic features in UiPath led me to produce an open-source UiPath activity library RealCryptoActivities, built on top of the .NET Bouncy Castle cryptographic library, which supports RSA/PKCS1Padding and AES256/ECB/PKCS7Padding encryption in the most transparent way possible.
